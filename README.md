# djctb - play osu! catch the beat with a dj deck

The code provided in this repository is still pretty buggy. It hardly relies on threading due to how slow python is. If you want to contribute, feel free to create pull requests.

## Running the script:
1. Install mido, pyautogui, threading and time.
2. Connect your dj controller and run the script, it will print all awailable midi devices at the start.
3. Replace the variable midi_name with your devices name written in the console.
4. Some dj controllers might be different. I will make it easier in the future to configure the script for your device. For now, if your device is different, you need to change the if statements yourself.
5. If everying is correct, you can run the script and start playing.
